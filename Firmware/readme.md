This is my first keyboard and I decided to make a small cut, copy, and paste board.
The board has 'Ctrl', 'X', 'C' and 'V'

### My Experience

I had a fun time making this keyboard, its a different side of engineering I enjoy.
I faced a few difficulties, mainly just the firmware, while making this but thanks to Hackclubs guides I got by.
